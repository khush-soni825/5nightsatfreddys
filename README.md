# Night Shift at Freddy's - Game Tutorial & Manual

## Overview
Welcome to "Night Shift at Freddy's", a survival horror game where you must survive until 6:00 AM while monitoring animatronic mascots that roam the building at night.

## Controls
The game is played entirely using the **Mouse**.
*   **Left Click**: Interact with buttons, doors, and the camera monitor.

## How to Play

### The Goal
Survive from **12:00 AM to 6:00 AM**.
You must prevent the animatronics from entering your office.

### The Office (Main Scene)
This is your safe room. You have limited visibility and resources.
*   **Doors**: You have two security doors (Left and Right).
    *   Click the **"DOOR L"** or **"DOOR R"** buttons to close/open them.
    *   **Warning**: Closing doors consumes power rapidly. Only close them when necessary!
*   **Monitor**: Click the **"MONITOR"** bar at the bottom to open/close the camera feed.
*   **Power**: Displayed in the bottom left. If it reaches 0%, the power goes out, doors open, and you are vulnerable.

### The Camera System
Use the monitor to track the animatronics.
*   **Map**: Click the camera buttons (e.g., "1A", "1B") on the map overlay to switch views.
*   **Strategy**: Find where the animatronics are. If they are missing from their usual spot, check the hallways (Cameras 2A, 2B) or the Pirate Cove (1C).

### The Animatronics
1.  **Freddy (Bear)**: Moves slowly but is hard to track in the dark. Approaches from the Left (usually).
2.  **Bonnie (Bunny)**: More active. Moves through the dining area and hallways. Approaches from the Right.
3.  **Foxy (Fox)**: (Nights 2-3) Hides in Pirate Cove (1C). If you don't check on him often, he will run down the hall to your office.

## Scenes Explained

### 1. Start Scene
The main menu. Displays the current Night you are about to attempt. Click anywhere or the "Start" button to begin the night.

### 2. Game Scene (The Night)
This is the core gameplay loop.
*   **Time Progression**: The night lasts approximately 60 seconds (scaled for this demo version).
*   **Power Drain**: Usage of doors and cameras increases power consumption.
*   **AI Movement**: The animatronics move periodically based on their "Aggression" level, which increases each night.

### 3. Jumpscare Scene
If an animatronic enters your office (because you didn't close the door in time), they will attack. This results in a "Game Over".

### 4. Win Scene
If you reach 6:00 AM, the night ends, and you survive. You can then proceed to the next night (up to Night 3).

## Tips for Survival
*   **Conserve Power**: Do not keep doors closed unless an animatronic is right outside.
*   **Check Lights**: (Not fully implemented in this demo, but usually you check lights before closing doors). In this version, rely on the cameras to see if they are close (Cam 2A/2B).
*   **Listen**: (Future update) Audio cues will help you locate enemies without using power on cameras.
